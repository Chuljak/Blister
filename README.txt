ABOUT

This is a text adventure style game. It has 6 dungeons, a town with a store and player house.
Every dungeon has a mechanic to it in order to beat it. The game is made extremely simple with basic python code.

The last dungeon is still unfinished and needs to be done sometime in the future. If you feel like it you can finish
it yourself. I just really don't know how to finish it anymore since I dragged this on for too long.
